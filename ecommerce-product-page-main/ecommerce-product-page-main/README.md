# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page

![Design preview for the E-commerce product page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)



**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this e-commerce product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it



## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.



You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.



## MY process
-Build With
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Flexbox
  - JavaScript

## What I learned
  - I learned a lot more about DOM manipulation. The goal of this project was to imporve my JS skills which mainly foucsed on DOM mainpulation. With the use of DOM manipulation I was able to code a working shopping cart in a efficent manner.

## Continued Development
 - In the project I have to make the main page responsive which I will do in the future. I did make the other pages responsive just to ensure I do know how to make something responsive.
